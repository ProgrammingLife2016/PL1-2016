## Notes
sprint:
-Definition: split devise and implementation
-Responsibility: Not everybody has important tasks (While Ali spends 24 hours on an A)

Reflection:
-Prioritisation: Test coverage/refactoring has an A?
-Reflection: Good analysis, should have more problems

EAD:
-no new version
-should implement previous feedback

EAD-changes:
-great amount of refactoring/restructuring, none of which documented in the EAD

Readability:
-Comments should sometimes be more specific, see Subject interface and such

CI:
-The Travis button is a png?

Tooling:
-Findbugs, PMD, CPD and Checkstyle issues
