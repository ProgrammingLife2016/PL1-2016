## Notes

Sprint
Definition: 8

- increase performance, by doing what?
- same goes for decreasing memory

Splitting: 9

Responsibility: 10

Reflection
Estimation: 8

Prioritisation: 9

Reflection: 7

- Not a lot of reflection
- For example on "show the correct level at the client" could be an elaboration

Code Evolution
Architecture
Changes: 5
Document: 3

- No new document
- Should still implement previous feedback

CQ: 9

Code Readability
Formatting: 9
Naming: 10
Comments: 4

- Comments missing and sometimes vague, still

CI
Building: 6
Testing: 10

- The Travis button still only links to a png, fix this
- Still merging builds that are not working

Tooling: 10

PBD
Branching: 8
Code Review: 7

- Some branches getting really behind master
- clean up branches
- Code Review a whole lot of LGTM
